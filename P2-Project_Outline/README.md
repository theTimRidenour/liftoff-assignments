## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am creating an e-commerce app for my clothing line Broke Shirts. This will give the general public an easy way to browse and purchase there favorite Broke merchandise. It will also allow myself to add and remove products, keep track of merchandise and orders. It will also allow me to authorize and track returns and refunds, and reward users with coupon codes.

### Features
Inventory manager
Product manager
Search and sort (color, size, type, category)
Cart
Coupon system
Return authorization
Order processing

### Technologies
Java 8
Spring Boot 2.1.4
Mysql
Square API
React
React Native

### What I'll Have to Learn
For this app I will have to learn the React JS library, React Native and the Square API. The React library will be used for the front end to give the user a more dynamic experience with less load time. The Square API (and SDK) will be used to handle all payments through the app. If time allows I would also like to make a mobile app for both Androids and IOS. If I have time for the mobile app I will have to learn React Native.
